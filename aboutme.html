          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            This is my personal space to share my passions, projects, and the journey I've been on. 
            Whether you're here to explore my work or just browsing, I hope you find something that 
            resonates with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since I was a kid, I've been captivated by computers and technology, but it all really 
            started with video games. Playing games wasn't just fun for me—it sparked a curiosity about 
            how they worked behind the scenes. I remember wondering how worlds were built, characters 
            were animated, and mechanics were programmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            That early passion for gaming eventually led me down the path of programming. I wanted to 
            create, not just consume. Over time, I began learning how to build my own games and applications, 
            turning that curiosity into real skills.

          <h2>Current Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I'm pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science </strong>, where I'm deepening 
            my understanding of ML and AI, algorithms, software engineering, and systems design. I've also had the 
            opportunity to work at <strong>Apple</strong>, where I've gained insight into both 
            the technical and business side of the tech world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I worked at <strong>The US Embassy New Delhi</strong> and <strong>The US Embassy 
            Addis Ababa</strong>, experiences that broadened my perspective on technology's global impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm driven by that same sense of wonder that video games sparked in me years ago, and I'm 
            excited to see where it will lead.
